Extremely proud to present [the result](/publications/) of the LOGML research project I have been involved in for the last 3 months under the supervision of Gabriele Cesa. Equivariance for the win! 

I also gave a talk about the paper recently at the FFT seminar of Helmholtz AI. Please find the slides [here](/assets/pdf/INF_FFT_0812.pdf).
