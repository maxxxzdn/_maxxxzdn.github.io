I am research assistant at Helmholtz AI @ HZDR in [the group of Nico Hoffmann](https://photon-ai-research.github.io). The goal of my current research is to develop data-efficient solutions for inverse problems in physics. 

My research interests comprise the fusion of geometric deep learning and deep generative modelling. I am interested in developing robust, trustworthy and data-efficient generative models for molecular modelling and physics applications. 

Previously, I worked on graph neural networks and generative modelling with applications in neuroscience. Long ago, I developed statistical models of clinical treatment in [the group of Ingmar Glauche](https://tu-dresden.de/med/mf/imb/forschung/arbeitsgruppen-am-imb/ag-glauche-theoretische-stammzellbiologie).
