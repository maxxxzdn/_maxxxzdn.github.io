  abstract = {Functional connectivity plays an essential role in modern neuroscience. The modality sheds light on the brain's functional and structural aspects, including mechanisms behind multiple pathologies. One such pathology is schizophrenia which is often followed by auditory verbal hallucinations. The latter is commonly studied by observing functional connectivity during speech processing. In this work, we have made a step toward an in-depth examination of functional connectivity during a dichotic listening task via deep learning for three groups of people: schizophrenia patients with and without auditory verbal hallucinations and healthy controls. We propose a graph neural network-based framework within which we represent EEG data as signals in the graph domain. The framework allows one to 1) predict a brain mental disorder based on EEG recording, 2) differentiate the listening state from the resting state for each group and 3) recognize characteristic task-depending connectivity. Experimental results show that the proposed model can differentiate between the above groups with state-of-the-art performance. Besides, it provides a researcher with meaningful information regarding each group's functional connectivity, which we validated on the current domain knowledge.},

  abstract={Neuroimaging techniques produce high-dimensional, stochastic data from which it might be challenging to extract high-level knowledge about the phenomena of interest. We address this challenge by applying the framework of generative modelling to 1) classify multiple pathologies, 2) recover neurological mechanisms of those pathologies in a data-driven manner and 3) learn robust representations of neuroimaging data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach to identifying schizophrenia, either followed or not by auditory verbal hallucinations. We further demonstrate the ability of the framework to learn disease-related mechanisms that are consistent with current domain knowledge. We also compare the proposed framework with several benchmark approaches and indicate its advantages.},

The framework implements the physics-informed neural network approach on scale. Physics informed neural networks allow strong scaling by design. Therefore, we have developed a framework that uses data parallelism to accelerate the training of physics informed neural networks significantly. To implement data parallelism, we use the Horovod framework, which provides near-ideal speedup on multi-GPU regimes.}
