  abstract = {Functional connectivity plays an essential role in modern neuroscience. The modality sheds light on the brain's functional and structural aspects, including mechanisms behind multiple pathologies. One such pathology is schizophrenia which is often followed by auditory verbal hallucinations. The latter is commonly studied by observing functional connectivity during speech processing. In this work, we have made a step toward an in-depth examination of functional connectivity during a dichotic listening task via deep learning for three groups of people: schizophrenia patients with and without auditory verbal hallucinations and healthy controls. We propose a graph neural network-based framework within which we represent EEG data as signals in the graph domain. The framework allows one to 1) predict a brain mental disorder based on EEG recording, 2) differentiate the listening state from the resting state for each group and 3) recognize characteristic task-depending connectivity. Experimental results show that the proposed model can differentiate between the above groups with state-of-the-art performance. Besides, it provides a researcher with meaningful information regarding each group's functional connectivity, which we validated on the current domain knowledge.},

  abstract = {Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) is a modern imaging technique used in material research to study nanoscale materials. Reconstruction of the parameters of an imaged object imposes an ill-posed inverse problem that is further complicated when only an in-plane GISAXS signal is available. Traditionally used inference algorithms such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) rely on computationally expensive scattering simulation software, rendering analysis highly time-consuming. We propose a simulation-based framework that combines variational auto-encoders and normalizing flows to estimate the posterior distribution of object parameters given its GISAXS data. We apply the inference pipeline to experimental data and demonstrate that our method reduces the inference cost by orders of magnitude while producing consistent results with ABC.},

  abstract={Electroencephalography produces high-dimensional, stochastic data from which it might be challenging to extract high-level knowledge about the phenomena of interest. We address this challenge by applying the framework of variational auto-encoders to 1) classify multiple pathologies and 2) recover the neurological mechanisms of those pathologies in a data-driven manner. Our framework learns generative factors of data related to pathologies. We provide an algorithm to decode those factors further and discover how different pathologies affect observed data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach to identifying schizophrenia, either followed or not by auditory verbal hallucinations. We further demonstrate the ability of the framework to learn disease-related mechanisms consistent with current domain knowledge. We also compare the proposed framework with several benchmark approaches and indicate its classification performance and interpretability advantages.},

The framework implements the physics-informed neural network approach on scale. Physics informed neural networks allow strong scaling by design. Therefore, we have developed a framework that uses data parallelism to accelerate the training of physics informed neural networks significantly. To implement data parallelism, we use the Horovod framework, which provides near-ideal speedup on multi-GPU regimes.}

  abstract={Diagnosing neurological diseases is a challenging process hindered by the immense complexity of the human brain. Neurological examination generally consists of obtaining data from different modalities and recognising disease-indicated patterns in it. Every modality, however, provides a clinician with high-dimensional and often stochastic data that can be difficult to analyze for a human and make decisions regarding a patient's status. It encourages the application of machine learning algorithms that are able to operate with large volumes of data and efficiently perform classification.

Generally, the highly desired properties of a machine learning model deployed in a medical domain are robustness and interpretability. In the last decade, many algorithms were proposed to assist clinicians in recognising disease-related patterns on medical images and participating in the decision-making process. Those models were claimed to match or even surpass a human expert yet they generally underperformed when applied in the clinical environment to real-world data. It was due to their failure to learn causal relations from data instead relying on statistical associations evident in a large amount of data. Besides, interpretability is often omitted from the consideration which does not allow one to gain insights from data and hence improve knowledge about the system of interest. Combined with poor generalization, it leads to the rare application of machine learning in medicine.

We address the aforementioned problems by using the framework of generative modeling to develop an algorithm that is able to recover generative factors from data as well as use them for differentiating between multiple mental disorders. We demonstrate that learning such factors is equivalent to extracting causal mechanisms from data which is a prerequisite for robust classification. Since malfunctions are known to affect the neural activity of the brain, we incorporate them into the model as a supervision bias. It allows us to learn disorder-related causal mechanisms which can be further explored and possibly lead to gaining new knowledge about those diseases. The method demonstrates excellent classification performance and learns disease-related generative factors that are consistent with current domain knowledge.},
